Problem Statement :-

A leading retail company wants to better understand its customers' shopping behavior in order to
improve sales, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty. The management team has noticed
changes in purchasing patterns across demographics, product categories, and sales channels
(online vs. offline). They are particularly interested in uncovering which factors, such as discounts,
reviews, seasons, or payment preferences, drive consumer decisions and repeat purchases.

You are tasked with analyzing the company's consumer behavior dataset to answer the following
overarching business question:

"How can the company leverage consumer shopping data to identify trends, improve
customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?"
